<p style="text-align: center;">
    My name is Andrew Brusoe, I live in Rochester Hills, Michigan and am a 26 year old who primarily uses he/him pronouns. I currently work in the mortgage industry but have decided that is not the field for me, so to pivot to web development I started taking
    a full-stack Java course with Grand Circus.
    <br>Outside of coding a lot of my interests still revolve around tech to at least a degree; as far as video games I tend to play a lot of Legend of Zelda, Pok√©mon, and Assassin's Creed and outside of that much of my free time is spent online.
    <br>Non tech-based interests include collecting trivia (I have been called a bastion of useless trivia and bad jokes, a title I proudly accept) and learning what I can about various langauges (if not the langauges themselves).

    <br>Aside from the social media pages listed in the footer, the best way to reach me is through email <a href="mailto:abrusoe1@gmail.com">here</a>.
