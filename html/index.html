    Coding Experience
</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">
    I am currently taking a full-stack Java bootcamp with Grand Circus that also covers things like MySQL, HTML, and CSS. So far this class has been going very well for me, as I have gotten 100% on each assessment to date aside from the first one; on
    that one I got an 80% but what caused that score has long been rectified.
    <br>This class started in late October of 2022 and will end in early May, with 28 weeks total of instruction.

    Outside of Coding
</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">
    In December of 2019 I graduated from Michigan State University with a BA in Linguistics and a minor in German; out of the subfields of linguistics, I was best at phonetics and phonology.
    <br> In this program I became acquainted with Praat, a program which shows the waveforms of a sound file that was put in; each sound in a language having its own characteristics in these waveforms.
    <br> Currently I work as an invoice specialist at UWM but I look forward to what the future brings once I have full-stack development fully under my belt.
